could be simplified,
if data are in 2D table.

for r in rows-1 .. 1:
  val[r][i] = max(val[r+1][i],  val[r+1][i+1])

print rows[0][0]

-----------
or in 1D array:
index of children of previous node is -1 if in tree or -2 if going up level

 width = "width"
 loop = width
 while not top:
    loop--
    child--
    if loop == 0:
       width--
       loop = width
       child --
    [curr].val = [curr].val + [child].val + [child+1].val
